# Data Visualization using Tableau

Below is a screenshot of my data visualization in Tableau Public.

I recommend visiting my Tableau Public profile page at this [link](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/paxton2033/viz/SalesandWorkloadinRetailIndustry/Dashboard1),
because this dashboard is interactive with the filters on the side.

The main purpose of this dashboard is to present the total sales, total cumulated hours worked, and average
department ratio between the hours worked by each department compared to the amount of hours each store was open.

The 3 charts included show the sales, cumulated hours, and average department hours ratio for each month data was
collected (10/2016 - 05/2017) and adjusts depending on the filters selected.

The filters allow you to view specific departments, store locations, and regions where stores are located.
